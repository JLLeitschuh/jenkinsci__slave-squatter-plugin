  Reserve a number of executors during the certain period, so that Jenkins will not use those
  executors to perform builds. Useful for making Jenkins aware of activities outside Jenkins
  &mdash; such as when you are using people's workstations as slaves (which need to be available
  for interactive use during day time) or when the system goes through a periodical backup,
  which reduces the I/O capability of the system.
